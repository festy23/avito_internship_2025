# Git Workflow

## Branch Roles

- `main` is the release branch. It accepts reviewed, tested, and merged work. Deploys come from here.
- `dev` is the integration branch for ongoing work. It may be unstable but must build.
- All other branches are temporary and named by purpose.

## Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feature/<module>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/pullrequest/reassign-improvements`).
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<module>/<short-description>` (e.g., `hotfix/user/deactivate-batch`).
- Experiment branches: `exp/<team>/<topic>` (e.g., `exp/team/async-assign`).
- Support branches (docs or infra): `support/<topic>` (e.g., `support/docker-compose-update`).

## Workflow Steps

1. Create a branch from `dev` for new work: `git checkout -b feature/user/add-status`.
2. Keep commits focused and rebased onto the latest `dev`.
3. Push the branch and open a pull request into `dev`.
4. After reviews and automated checks pass, merge (prefer fast-forward).
5. Periodically merge `dev` into `main` for releases; protect `main`.

## Example Scenarios

- Feature: create `feature/team/auto-assign` → work → PR into `dev` → merge.
- Hotfix: start `hotfix/pullrequest/bad-merge` from `main`, fix, merge into `main` and backport to `dev`.
- Support: open `support/logging-config`, update documentation, merge into `dev`.
- Experiment: create `exp/user/circuit-breaker` to test behavior; delete when done.
- Emergency doc fix: `hotfix/docs/readme-typo` from `main`, merge to `main` and `dev`.

## PR Guidelines

- Target `dev` unless the change is critical and needs an immediate release.
- Use descriptive titles and link to relevant tasks.
- Keep PRs small; split large work into multiple feature branches.

## COMMITS

Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Creating Pull Request

### Название

`<type>(<scope>): <описание>`

examples:

- `feat(pullrequest): добавить автоматическое назначение ревьюверов`
- `fix(user): исправить валидацию активности`
